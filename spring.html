  <h1>Spring</h1>
    <h2>
    Spring is the time of year for the liver gallblader organs which control the flow of chi/inner dispositon and detoxification. When these organs are in balance you are full of compassion. When they are out of balance you can be quick to anger.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The taste of this season is sour. It's a good time to enjoy lemon or vinegar.</li>
      <li>Green is the color of liver organ and springtime and a great  time to add lots of young fresh greens to your diet.</li>
      <li>The liver organ correlates with the manipura (or solar plexis)chakra.</li>
      <li>For Jin shin jyutsu - jumper cable the middle finger to harmonize the Liver-Gallbladder meridian. Hold your left middle finger with your righthand for 2 minutes. Then switch hands.</li>
