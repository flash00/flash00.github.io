  <h1>Spring</h1>
    <h2>
    Spring is the time of year for the liver gallblader organs which control the flow of chi/inner dispositon and detoxification. When these organs are in balance you are full of compassion. But when they are out of balance you can be quick to anger.
    <ul>
      <li>The taste of this season is sour. So it's a good time to enjoy lemon or vinegar.</li>
      <li>Green is the color of liver and springtime and a good time to add lots of young fresh greens to your diet.</li>
      <li>The liver organ correlates with the manipura (or solar plexis)chakra.</li>
      <li>For Jin shin jyutsu - jumper cable the middle finger to harmonize the Liver-Gallbladder meridian.</li>
    </ul>
